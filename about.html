        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Taxila is a relatively small city but it still faces a large issue. It does not have a single public parking lot in the entire city and people park their cars on the road which create traffic jams especially in places such as Mughal Market and Central Taxila. In an effort to solve the problem, the parking lot was designed!</p><br>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to eliminate the parking problem in the city with a modern parking lot system that implements technology to make the design customer-friendly and also safe and secure.</p>

        <br><h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision is to expand the business throught the city and in long term expand it to other cities to revolutionize parking systems in the country.</p>
